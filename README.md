A chrome extension to enrol in courses on CMS quickly.

## Installing

Easy way: Install it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cms-enrollment-extension/ebjldebpahljhpakgngnandakdbajdnj?hl=en-GB) Do install from here, I paid $5 just to put it there :)

----

If you are skeptical about whether the same code is on the Chrome Web Store you can follow the below steps instead:

If you have git installed, run `git clone https://github.com/Akshat-Oke/CMS-Extension.git`

If you don't have git, download these files as ZIP (click `Code`(green button) and then "Download ZIP" in the dropdown above on this page), extract them into your desired folder and follow these steps:

1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) or edge://extensions (if you are using Edge)
2. Turn on "Developer Mode" at the top right
3. Click on `Load Unpacked`
4. Select the folder in which you extracted (or cloned) this repository
5. Enjoy!
